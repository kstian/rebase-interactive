# Colour
To see colour, you have to have light. When light shines on an object some colours bounce off the object and others are absorbed by it. Our eyes only see the colours that are bounced off or reflected.

The sun's rays contain all the colours of the rainbow mixed together. This mixture is known as white light. When white light strikes a white crayon or marker barrel, it appears white to us because it absorbs no colour and reflects all colour equally. A black crayon or marker cap absorbs all colours equally and reflects none, so it looks black to us. While artists consider black a colour, scientists do not because black is the absence of all colour.
